# README #

This repo is no longer maintained.

The configuration templates are written using liquid: https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers.

### What is this repository for? ###

The configuration templates that are deployed into the config-generator.ptns.pearson.com application.

### How do I get set up? ###

Currently there is no GIT interface into the web application, so this repo is just providing version control.  Configurations that are created should be manually installed into the config-generator.
